/*
1.Declare a Place variable that will keep track of the place number for which we are processing the work.
2.The value can be extracted by performing modulus operator on the given number.
3.In order to inverse the place and the number extracted in points 1 and 2 multiply the place with 10 ^ (rem - 1).
For e.gâ€¦, Place = 4 and rem = 3, then multiply place with 100 viz, ( 10 ^ (rem - 1)). 
4.Add the number to the previous ans.
